# CLI-Minesweeper
Console-based minesweeper game programmed in C++

This is a basic minesweeper game programmed in C++, programmed to be configurable in terms of grid size and mine density. The user is displayed a textual grid and is repeatedly prompted to input coordinates of a tile to uncover until they hit a mine or reveal all non-mine tiles. An executable file is included in the repository. Download this to a Windows machine and execute it to play. Otherwise, compile the included C++ code.
